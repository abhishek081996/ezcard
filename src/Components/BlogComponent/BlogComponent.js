        <p>    As such, the sector is largely seen as the next big frontier for financial innovation. However, as with all changes, the growth of cross-border payments will present a number of challenges and opportunities for banks, fintech, and regulators. So what can be prepared?
    <br/>Here we explore the future of cross-border payments, the social trends driving change and the hurdles financial service providers will need to overcome to offer seamless cross-border services.
    <br/>The driving factors are changing
    <br/>The ways we live and work are constantly evolving, and thanks to the changes brought about by the pandemic, the concept of a truly 'global' society have never been closer. Figures indicate that 270 million people worldwide no longer live and work in the country of their birth, an increase of 44% in less than 30 years. A wider shift towards more flexible telecommuting policies will undoubtedly support this, leading to more citizens moving abroad but staying with their current employers.
    <br/>Moreover, with the arrival of a new day for the travel sector in a post-COVID world, the digital behavior that took hold during the pandemic will have a ripple effect on consumer demands when it comes to currency exchange. The increased use of online banking and the shift to contactless payments means that solutions such as multi-currency wallets and mobile FX will see greater adoption as consumers begin to travel again.
    <br/>As the scale of international transactions grows exponentially, fintech and financial institutions will have a key role to play in innovating products and solutions that will ultimately provide better services that increase the speed, efficiency and security of cross-border payments, but what are the challenges? on the horizon, how does the industry currently stand?
    <br/>Challenges facing financial services
    <br/>Navigating the complex regulatory map is a key challenge for financial service providers when it comes to international expansion and cross-border payments. While this is less of an issue in regions like Europe (thanks to progressive regulation such as the establishment of the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA)), understanding the nuances of cross-border regulation in other markets can be a major barrier to growth. If a financial services provider wants to expand its offering across APAC, for example, it could potentially seek support for more than 50 different currencies before even beginning to understand how regulation varies across markets.
    <br/>Regulation is only one element of the global journey to seamless cross-border payments, but investment in new technologies and robust infrastructure will be equally essential to overall progress. One key example we are seeing across markets is the increase in governments exploring central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and the benefits they can bring. Key markets in APAC such as China and South Korea are already innovating in this space, with players across Europe and the US also following suit. CBDCs could play a vital role in facilitating cross-border transactions, as funds can be transferred between banks much faster (offering same-day settlement) and at much lower costs than traditional FX methods.
    <br/>Investments in digital currencies in the public sector will undoubtedly contribute to further innovation in cross-border payments, but without real global harmonization of systems and regulation, the concept of borderless payments is still a distant possibility. Global initiatives and regulatory frameworks such as ISO 20022, which standardizes the means by which financial institutions share data across borders, will play a critical role in driving truly seamless cross-border payments. Regulation can often be seen as a barrier to technological progress, however, by working with regulators when it comes to international payments, fintech companies can establish global mechanisms and standards on which future innovation will be based, creating solutions that prioritize ease of payment and data sharing. regardless of geography.
    <br/>Opportunities for Forex Brokers
    <br/>For Trading platforms embracing the globalization of payments, the long-term revenue opportunity is significant. As a result of the increasingly digital foreign exchange market and wider societal shifts towards living and working abroad, the value of cross-border payments is estimated to grow from almost US$150 trillion in 2017 to more than US$250 trillion by 2027, equivalent to an increase of more than 100 trillion dollars in 10 years. Opportunities and changes will also be driven by merchants themselves who, when entering new markets or working with suppliers in new territories, will require more responsive cross-border payment solutions, prioritizing key features such as same-day transfer. Although the road to borderless payments will be long and the challenges (both technological and regulatory) will be many, there are significant opportunities to be explored in both B2B and B2C.
    <br/>Passport to payments after COVID
    <br/>However, to unlock this potential, fintech needs to tap into the experience of trusted global players with proven expertise operating abroad. GPS has helped several customers in the financial space on their journeys to international growth, including the likes of UK start-up Revolut, which is now available in the APAC market. In 2021, we agreed to continue our long-term partnership with Revolut to bring its innovative services to customers in new and emerging areas.
    <br/>We can help businesses expand into new markets using our local connections and deep expertise in each country''s jurisdiction to help them navigate complex regulatory issues.
    <br/>Regardless of how financial service providers arrive at a solution, the fact is that change is coming, and banks and fintechs working on borderless payments now will find themselves at the forefront of the market in the long term and well-positioned for future growth and innovation."
